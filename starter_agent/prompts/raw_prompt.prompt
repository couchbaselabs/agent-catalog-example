# This field is used at provider time to search the catalog for tools.
# This field is optional, and does not have to be present.
tools:
  # Tools can be specified using the same parameters found in Provider.get_tools_for.
  # For instance, we can condition on the tool name...

  # ...the tool name and some annotations...
  - name: "find_direct_routes"

  # ...or even a semantic search via the tool description.
