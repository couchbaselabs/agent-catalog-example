# As a supplement to the tool similarity search, users can optionally specify search annotations.
# The values of these annotations MUST be strings (e.g., not 'true', but '"true"').
# This field is optional, and does not have to be present.
annotations:
  gdpr_2016_compliant: "false"

# HTTP requests must be specified using an OpenAPI spec.
open_api:

  # The path relative to the tool-calling code.
  # The OpenAPI spec can either be in JSON or YAML.
  filename: path_to_openapi_spec.json

  # A URL denoting where to retrieve the OpenAPI spec.
  # The filename or the url must be specified (not both).
  # url: http://url_to_openapi_spec/openapi.json

  # Which OpenAPI operations should be indexed as tools are specified below.
  # This field is mandatory, and each operation is validated against the spec on index.
  operations:

    # All operations must specify a path and a method.
    # 1. The path corresponds to an OpenAPI path object.
    # 2. The method corresponds to GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE/HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE.
    # See https://swagger.io/specification/#path-item-object for more information.
